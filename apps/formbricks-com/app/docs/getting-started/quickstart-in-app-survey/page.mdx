#### Getting Started

# Quickstart

In app surveys have 6-10x better conversion rates than emailed out surveys. This tutorial explains how to run an in app survey in your web app in 10 to 15 minutes. Let‚Äôs go!

## Create a free Formbricks Cloud account

While you can [self-host](/docs/self-hosting/deployment) Formbricks, the quickest and easiest way to get started is with the free Cloud plan. Just [sign up here](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup) and click through the onboarding, until you‚Äôre here:

  className="max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl rounded-lg "
/>

## Create your first survey

To be able to see a survey in your app, you need to create one. We‚Äôll choose one of the templates and head over to the survey settings:

<Image
  src={I2}
  alt="Settings for popup survey inside web app"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

As you can see in the orange note here, we have not yet connected Formbricks Cloud with our app. We will do so in just a minute, let‚Äôs first setup the survey correctly.

Select ‚ÄúWeb App‚Äù in the How to ask settings:

<Image
  src={I3}
  alt="Survey settings for popup micro surve"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Scroll down to Survey Trigger and choose ‚ÄúNew Session‚Äù. This will cause this survey to appear when the Formbricks Widget tracks a new user session:

<Image
  src={I4}
  alt="In app survey trigger for feedback popup micro survey"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

In **Recontact Options** we choose the following settings, so that we can play around with the survey more easily. By default, each survey will be shown only once to each user to prevent survey fatigue:

<Image
  src={I5}
  alt="Options for survey popup in app micro survey"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Now hit **Publish** and you‚Äôll be forwarded to the Summary Page. This is where you‚Äôll find the responses to this survey. On the Summary Page click through to the Setup Checklist:

<Image
  src={I6}
  alt="pop up survey settings for inapp web survey"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Set up the Formbricks Widget in your app

On the Setup Checklist you have two elements. At the top you find the Widget Status Indicator. Once your app is connected to Formbricks Cloud successfully, this will turn green:

<Image
  src={I7}
  alt="feedback popup in app survey"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

In the manual below, this code snippet contains all the information you need:

- The **Environment ID** of your current Formbricks workspace
- The **API Host** which is ‚Äòhttps://app.formbricks.com‚Äô for Cloud users

<Image
  src={I8}
  alt="settings for in app survey popping up"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Load Formbricks widget in your app

In a local instance of your app, you'll embed the Formbricks Widget. Dependent on your frontend tech, the setup differs a bit:

- [Next.JS App Directory](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#next-js)
- [Next.JS Pages Directory](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#next-js)
- [React (Create React App)](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#react-js)
- [Vue.JS](/docs/getting-started/framework-guides#vue-js)

## Restart your app and open browser console

Now, restart your app in your terminal to make sure the widget is loaded. Once its loaded, open the browser console to see the Formbricks debug logs. If you did everything right, you should now see your survey in the lower right corner:

<Image
  src={ReactApp}
  alt="In app survey in React app for micro surveys"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

## Most frequent errors and how to debug them

In case you don‚Äôt see your survey right away, here's what you can do. Go through these in orderly to find the error fast:

### Formbricks Cloud and your app are not connected properly.

Go back to [app.formbricks.com](http://app.formbricks.com) and go to the Setup Checklist in the Settings. If the status is still indicated as ‚ÄúNot connected‚Äù your app hasn't yet pinged the Formbricks Cloud:

<Image
  src={I9}
  alt="setup checklist ui of survey popup for in app surveys"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>
**How to fix it:**

1. Check if your app loads the Formbricks widget correctly. Make sure you have `debug` mode enabled in your integration and you should see the Formbricks debug logs in your browser console while being in your app (right click in the browser, `Inspect`, switch to the console tab). If you don‚Äôt see them, double check your integration or if you are unable to solve this issue, please [join our Discord](https://formbricks.com/discord) and we‚Äôll help you out.

### Survey not loaded

If your app is connected with Formbricks Cloud, the survey might have not been loaded properly. Check the debug logs and search for the list of surveys loaded. It should look like so:

<Image
  src={I11}
  alt="survey logs for in app survey pop up micro"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

**How to fix it:**

The widget only loads surveys which are **public** and **in progress**. Go to Formbricks Cloud and to the Survey Summary page. Check if your survey is live:

<Image
  src={I10}
  alt="ui of survey popup for in app micro surveys"
  quality="100"
  className="rounded-lg max-w-full sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

---

### Survey not triggered

If the survey is loaded by the widget it might not have been triggered properly.

**How to fix:**

1. Open your local app in an incognito tab or window. The New Session event is only fired if a user was inactive for 60 minutes or was logged out of Formbricks via formrbicks.logout().
2. Check the debug logs for ‚ÄúEvent ‚ÄòNew Session‚Äù tracked‚Äù. If you see it in the logs and the survey still did not get displayed, [please let us know.](mailto:support@formbricks.com)

That should fix it! If not, please [join our Discord](https://formbricks.com/discord)! We‚Äôre more than happy to help you get started üòä

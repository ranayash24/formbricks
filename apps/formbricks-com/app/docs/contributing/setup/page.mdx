# Setup Dev Environment

To get the project running locally on your machine you need to have the following development tools installed:

- Node.JS (we recommend v18)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (to run PostgreSQL / MailHog)

1. Clone the project:

   <CodeGroup title="Git clone Formbricks monorepo">

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks
   ```

   </CodeGroup>

   and move into the directory

   <CodeGroup title="Move into the Formbricks monorepo">

   ```bash
   cd formbricks
   ```

   </CodeGroup>

1. Install Node.JS packages via pnpm. Don't have pnpm? Get it [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

   <CodeGroup title="Install dependencies via pnpm">

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   </CodeGroup>

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`. It's already preset to work with the docker-compose setup but you can also change values if needed.

   <CodeGroup title="Define environment variables">

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   </CodeGroup>

1. Make sure you have [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) & [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and running on your machine. Then run the following command to start the formbricks dev setup:

   <CodeGroup title="Start Formbricks Dev Setup">

   ```bash
   pnpm go
   ```

   </CodeGroup>

   This starts the Formbricks main app (plus all its dependencies) as well as the following services using Docker:

   - a `postgres` container for hosting your database,
   - a `mailhog` container that acts as a mock SMTP server and shows received mails in a web UI (forwarded to your host's `localhost:8025`)

   **You can now access the Formbricks app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. You will be automatically redirected to the login. To use your local installation of formbricks, create a new account.

   For viewing the confirmation email and other emails the system sends you, you can access mailhog at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)

### Build

To build all apps and packages and check for build errors, run the following command:

<CodeGroup title="Build Formbricks stack">

```bash
pnpm build
```

</CodeGroup>

### Access Demo app

To run the [Demo app](/docs/contributing/demo), run the following command in a separate terminal window:

<CodeGroup title="Start Formbricks Demo App">

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=demo
```

</CodeGroup>

You can now access the Demo app on [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).

### Access Formbricks website

If you want to make changes to the Formbricks website, e.g. to update the documentation, run the following command in a separate terminal window:

<CodeGroup title="Start Formbricks Website">

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=formbricks-com
```

</CodeGroup>

You can now access the Formbricks website on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

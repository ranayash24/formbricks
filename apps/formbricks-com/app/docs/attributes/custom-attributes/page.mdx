#### Attributes

# Setting attributes with code

One way to send attributes to Formbricks is in your code. In Formbricks, there are two special attributes for [user identification](/docs/attributes/identify-users)(user ID & email) and custom attributes. An example:

## Setting Custom User Attributes

You can use the setAttribute function to set any custom attribute for the user (e.g. name, plan, etc.):

<CodeGroup title="Setting Plan to Pro">

```javascript
formbricks.setAttribute("Plan", "Pro");
```

</CodeGroup>

Generally speaking, the setAttribute function works like this:

<CodeGroup title="Setting Custom Attributes">

```javascript
formbricks.setAttribute("attribute_key", "attribute_value");
```

</CodeGroup>

Where `attributeName` is the name of the attribute you want to set, and `attributeValue` is the value of the attribute you want to set.

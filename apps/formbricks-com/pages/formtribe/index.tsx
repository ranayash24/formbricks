const FAQ = [
  {
    question: "Is this part of Formbricks or a different tool?",
    answer:
      "The link survey is part of the Formbricks core product. The code is managed in the Formbricks mono repository.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why are there only 30ish issues to work on?",
    answer:
      "We believe in Quality over Quantity. We‚Äôre a small team and want to be able to pay enough attention to each of the contributors.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can everyone win?",
    answer:
      "There are 64 prizes. Every contributor can only win 1 prize, so there will be 64 winners. Every contributor has a chance to win. The more points you make, the higher your chance to win.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I have to sign a CLA?",
    answer:
      "To assure this project to be financially viable, we have to be able to relicense the code for enterprise customers and governments. To be able to do so, we are legally obliged to have you sign a CLA.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where will this be hosted?",
    answer:
      "We offer a Formbricks Cloud with a generous free plan but you can also easily self-host using Docker.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the FormTribe?",
    answer: "The FormTribe is what we call our community of contributors.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is there a Commercial plan?",
    answer:
      "The commercial plan is for features who break the OSS WIN-WIN Loop or incur additional cost. We charge 29$ if you want a custom domain, remove Formbricks branding, collect large files in surveys or collect payments. We think that‚Äôs fair :)",
  },
  {
    question: "Are your in app surveys also free forever?",
    answer:
      "The in app surveys you can run with Formbricks are not part of this Deal. We offer a generous free plan but keep full control over the pricing in the long run. In app surveys are really powerful for products with thousands of users and something has to bring in the dollars.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to pay duty for the SWAG?",
    answer: "No, we cover that.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take to receive the swag?",

  },
  {
    question: "When is the event happening?",
    answer: "1st of October until 31st of October",
  },
  {
    question: "Can everyone participate?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Even when you don‚Äôt know how to write code you can take part completing side quests. As long as you can open a PR you are very welcome to take part irrespective of your age, gender, nationality, food preferences, taste in clothing and favorite Pokemon.",

            Charlie Munger famously said <strong>‚ÄúShow me the incentives and I show you the outcome‚Äù.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The beauty of Open Source Software (and the reason for its inevitable domination) is that
            incentives between the different groups of users and developers are perfectly aligned.
          </p>

          <p>Let‚Äôs have a look:</p>

          <Image src={OSSLoop} alt="oss loop" />

          <p>With open-source software, everyone wins:</p>

          <p>
            The community of contributors gets to learn on the job working on a real product with real users.
            The free users get to use a feature-complete product free of charge. we don‚Äôt have to pay insane
            sales people salaries to sell our enterprise solution in the future.{" "}
            <strong>Welcome to the OSS win-win loop‚Ñ¢</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why we have decided to spend the complete month of Hacktoberfest hacking away with you,
            our community!
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold sm:text-xl">But why would you hack with us?</p>

          <p>There‚Äôs a couple of reasons, but let‚Äôs first nail this down:</p>

          <p>
            The time for an elegant <strong>üëè</strong>, open source <strong>üëè</strong> survey builder has
            come. It has been tried before, but it has never been maintained long enough because it‚Äôs hard to
            make money with a free tool.
          </p>

          <p>This is why the FormTribe is coming together this October!</p>

          <p>And you can be a part of it!</p>

          <p>
            Imagine yourself flexing on a date that your code is used by thousands and soon millions of
            people!
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold sm:text-xl">
            Apart from you dating life levelling up, here are some proper reasons:

            <li>You‚Äôll earn your spot of honour on our Community page on formbricks.com</li>
            <li>
              You‚Äôll be working closely with the Formbricks team, shipping features which have been requested
